            <div class="text">A plague has broken out. The world is in chaos. What we thought to be our only hope, ended up being 
                our greatest mistake. A vaccine that waS being developped to cure this plague, turned everyone into zombies. There
                 are very few survivors, food is scarce, and the zombies are getting hungry. Rumors of a doctor who has the real 
                 cure have been circulating. However, he is stuck in the basement of an abondonned warehouse, completely across
                town. You are selected to go and get him and his cure. Can you save the world and escape the biohazard?  </div>
